The name of the Musailha Castle in Batroun means the armed or fortified place, and studies and accounts differ about the history of its construction, as some historians say that it dates back to the last Ayyubid era, and others say that it was built by the Crusaders, but most studies indicate that it was built by the Lebanese Prince Fakhr al-Din II al-Ma‚Äôani.  The castle was used throughout the ages for defensive military purposes, and today it is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Lebanon.",Mseilha Fort,Hamat,34.283,35.7,North Lebanon,Historical Sites,4.4,581,great monument main feature famous icon lira banknote civil war name armed fortified study account history construction historian last ayyubid era other crusader study ani castle age defensive military purpose today famous tourist attraction

82,Alberto Pala,a year ago,5,"Beyond Batroun, on the highway in the direction of Tripoli, along the Nahr el-Jawz river, an unusual fortification built on a rocky spur can be seen on the right, like a mirage that enchants you from afar.
The  sandstone blocks were brought in from the nearby coast, and it is certain that it was built by Emir Fakhreddine II from 1624 onwards. In fact, it is speculated, not incorrectly, that it was probably built on top of a pre-existing Crusader defence structure.
You get there via a steep staircase and inside there are many dark, somewhat ghostly rooms, but the view is worth the effort.
Enjoy your visit/Buona visita

Al Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve is a nature reserve in the Chouf District of Lebanon. It is located on the slopes of Barouk mountain and has an area of 550 km2 (210 sq mi), nearly 5.3% of the Lebanese territory.
The reserve contains the Lebanon cedar forests of Barouk, Maaser el Shouf and Ain Zhalta-Bmohray. It is an Important Bird Area (IBA) and Eco-tourism area. It hosts 32 species of wild mammals, 200 species of birds, and 500 species of plants.
The cedar forests of Lebanon enjoy the unique distinction as the oldest documented forests in history. The cedars were important enough in the history of man to be traceable to the very earliest written records, that of the Sumerians in the third millennium BC. In the ancient Sumerian story, The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest pieces of literature in the world, the cedars feature prominently.

By Ali Badawi
Batroun's Old City ""The Batruna""

Batroun City is one of the oldest cities of the world and it was one of the most important Phoenician Towns and Harbors. It was mentioned in many texts of the old days and the eldest of those goes back to the 2nd Millennium B.C. Batroun was the same as all other coastal towns that have faced many invasions all through history. Accordingly,all nations including Greeks, Romans. Muslims, Crusaders, Ottomans, and even modern days countries as the French have invaded Batroun and tried to capture the town as long as they could. However, and as most Lebanese Towns, Batroun has always rebelled and forced all invaders out and become as strong as ever.

Historians believe that the Greek name of the town originates from the Phoenician word, bater, which means to cut and it refers to the maritime wall that the Phoenicians built in the sea to protect them from tidal waves. Other historians believe that the name of the town is a derivative of the Phoenician words, beit truna, which translates to house of the chief. Some other historians call it the Batruna, and this is what I would also be calling it.

Batroun's Old City ""The Batruna"" extends round a circular bay with its characteristic port of classic form; there is a sheltered road stead to the north of the town and another to the south, close to which is the ‚ÄúPool of the King‚Äôs Daughter‚Äù (Birket Bint el Malak), the shipbuilding yard and the ‚ÄúThrone of the Prince‚Äù (Maqaad el Mir).

Batruna has many historical cathedrals and churches such as those of; Saint Stephan‚Äôs Cathedral, Saint George Church, The Marketplace Lady church ""Saydet el Saha"", and The Miraculous Sea Lady Church ""Sadyet el Bahr"". Those have added beauty to the place and believers with tourists love to visit those and enjoy capturing photos there.

Batruna's old souks and alleys run alongside the historical churches and walking those is always joyful especially with the old people one meets and talk to. Moreover, the shore of the old Phoenician City is still protected by the remaining parts of the famous maritime wall that is still clear next to the beautiful fishermen Marina facing the miraculous Church of ‚ÄúOur Lady Of The Sea‚Äù.

I walked all the alleys of the old city, prayed inside its churches, and tasted its famous Lemonade and wonderful fish food. I'll repeat this every time I visit the city, and I'll keep enjoying its beauty... - ""Ziad Yazbek""",Batroun Old Souk,Batroun,34.2498,35.6643,North Lebanon,Traditional Markets,4.5,749,old city old old city world important phoenician town harbor many text old day eld coastal town many invasion history nation greek crusader modern day country capture town town forced invader strong historian greek name town phoenician word bater maritime wall phoenician sea protect tidal wave historian name town derivative phoenician word beit truna chief old city circular characteristic port classic form road stead north town south close pool shipbuilding yard throne prince many historical cathedral church saydet beauty believer tourist photo old alley historical church joyful old people old phoenician city part famous maritime wall clear next beautiful fisherman marina miraculous alley old city church famous lemonade wonderful fish food city beauty yazbek

5132,Mr. G,9 months ago,1,"This palace should be dubbed the ""Palace of the ten argyle rooms"", as that is about all there is to it, at least on the public side we had access to.

Entrance was about 0.50USD compared to its previous 6.5USD due to the depreciation of the lira, but 50 cents is about what the experience is worth.

Most of the rooms are closed and almost every corridor is blocked by a bride/groom couple wanting to make a video or snap a photo in the least exciting location, surrounded by tourist, they can find.

The publicly available areas are all poorly decorated *cough-empty* argyle smoking rooms expect for a single bedroom and washroom. All art and furniture has been seemingly removed from the palace except for some poorly preserved and looked after mosaics.

Don't let the allure of the mosaics fool you though. Pieces are mostly under very poor lighting, covered in dust, or if they have a plaque it would read ""Of unknown origin from somewhere not here and made around 500-600 CE."" That is to say if they have any inscription at all.

We were able to view the entire complex in under 35 minutes, with a child, if that tells you anything. So much lost potential in a country with over 7000 years of history.

(The photos are the views from the central courtyard and was about the best part of the excursion.)",Beiteddine Palace,Beiteddine,33.6948,35.5813,Mount Lebanon,Historical Sites,4.6,1971,palace palace argyle room public side access entrance 0.50usd previous due depreciation lira cent worth room corridor bride groom couple video snap photo exciting location tourist available area cough empty argyle smoking room single bedroom washroom art furniture palace mosaic allure mosaic fool piece poor lighting dust plaque unknown origin inscription able entire complex minute child potential country year history photo central courtyard good part excursion

The palace was declared a Historic Monument after it was restored in 1934.

The upper floor houses the Rashid Karami Archeological and Ethnographic Museum, which contains a miniature replica of the palace to provide visitors with an idea of the structure‚Äôs original form.

A helicopter zoomed overhead at one point. Honestly we had no idea what was going on and almost wanted to turn around and go back to avoid danger. But it was quite the opposite. The Maronite Patriarch was celebrating mass in the church we wanted to visit. The road there is more like a walk way. Take comfortable shoes and lots of water. It gets really hot in summer. The monastery was packed out so I could hardly take a good look but it was still beautiful and sentimental. The path can be better. I hope they fix it.

The monastery was built in a rocky pit, most probably by Byzantine emperor Theodos the Great in 379 - 395. No remains are left from the Byzantine convent, and from the medieval period, only a painting representing the face of an angel remains. The walls of the church dedicated to the Virgin Mary are decorated with mural paintings dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries, representing a vision of the Old Testament and the Virgin Mary with local saints. The monastery was rehabilitated in 1990 and is now used by the Antonine Sisters who welcome pilgrims to spend the night

They offer several trails starting from easy to hard. The trails are predefined and easy to follow no chance in getting lost without a guide only pick up the map at the entrance a fee of 5000Lbp per person will be applied which is very affordable.
The best trail in my opinion and you will almost cover the entire reserve and see all the bio diversity and all the gorgeous views is the following:
Starting from 1>5>shortcut to 4> 4 towards 3> 3 towards 2 and finally reaching the starting point.
Trail  1 and 5: an uphill
Trail 4 and 3: downhill
Trail 2: flatten dirt trail
It will take about 3.5 hours for a normal person while taking photos and resting. It's about 9km consisting of uphills and downhills.

For yr. info, the entry price of L.P. 18.315,-  or $ 12,21 / adult is not expensive due to the fact that 40% of the entry tickets go to the government i.e.: the Tourism Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the Municipality and from the remaining amount of L.P. 11.010,-- for our company we have to cover a lot of expenses such as the salaries of around 140 employees, social security contributions, maintenance works, equipment costs, electricity,  fuel, publicity, etc.. As u know, the tour takes around 1 h. 30 and you benefit from a whole range of attractions such as: Rope way - Slide show theater- visit of the dry upper grotto- train - visit of the lower grotto with water via boat- watching zoo with pet animals- relaxing in a Phoenician garden, etc. You pay for us :
- 1,--   $ to visit the upper grotto
- 2,40 $  ‚Äú     ‚Äú     ‚Äú    lower     ‚Äú      with boat

Do you know any cave in worldwide where you can visit at this price ?
The entry prices are fixed by the Tourism Ministry.
All our efforts and tremendous work to preserve this natural wonder have been crowned by earning many important prizes and testimonials from famous specialists that resulted in the international recognition of the cave. When this touristic project was boosted in July 1995, no one dared at this time to run such project. It was risky to manage such important touristic site in the country in an unstable security situation of the whole Middle East region.
Cell phones and cameras are not allowed because we have a lot of reasons for prohibiting photography:
.to protect sightseer privacy when some visitors can inadvertently appear in the photos
.to respect the ambiance of the grottoes and the environment
.to not annoy visitors by taking various poses
.to avoid falling down while climbing over the rocks to take pictures
.etc.
If u visit any museum or cave in worldwide, it's not allowed also to take any pictures and it‚Äôs mention at the entrance: No photography!
It‚Äôs not necessary to mention the discovery year of the grotto on the posters as the year is mentioned in the brochures and also in the slides show documentary film in the theater.

11849,SHAIK DADAPEER,a year ago,5,"We thank you for yr. visit and the time you took to make a comment.
For yr. info, the metal balustrades are heightening more than 1 m. although that the standard height of a fence is 90 cm. A security specialist Co. checked the balustrades of the caves and told that the height of the fence is good and conform to international standard.
As this is a cave, it's normal to have wet pathways because water droplets are dripping from the ceiling on the floor. Not all the pathways are wet but some of them and, that's why, instructive billboards are fixed in the cave to aware the visitors to pay attention for the slippery floor. It's a rough concrete floor to prevent the slippery ground.
We clean the pathways from time to time with the water of the lower grotto.
Do you have any suggestion for slippery floor in a cave ?
Do you think that necessary security measures are taken in worldwide touristic sites to avoid any potential accident ? Strict security measures are taken in our touristic site to satisfy our visitors and secure their tour. Daily maintenance works are go ahead to prevent any accident as we have a lot of attractions in the complex such as: ropeway, train, boat, etc.
We think that the grotto deserves a much better comment for ranking on Google.
We do our utmost to protect and preserve the cave and keep it intact and the result of our tremendous work is crowned by our earning of many awards in various fields: touristic, environmental, social, economic, etc..

16303,Charbel Abiad,7 months ago,5,"The best museum I've ever visited in Lebanon.

You will see all kinds of minerals, crystals, gemstones and even fossils.
It is a private collection of Mr. Salim Edde from around the world and some from our beloved Lebanon as well.

I don't have the exact count of minerals but I'm sure it's well over 2000.
Each one unique in size, shape, colour and origin.
And if you're lucky enough to have the guided tour (with Mr Salim himself) each has its own story and its challenges to get it all the way to Mim museum.

Also, it's really easy to get there, the entrance fee is 10 000 LBP (which is absolutely nothing for a museum of that calibre), free entrance for studends and kids (who should definitely visit as well)

The decor is simply on point, it looks like those museums you see in movies and each room has a certain lighting to it to put more value on the items on display.

I'm sure kids and students will enjoy the tour as much, if not more, than adults.
The geometrical shapes of those stones, the million of years in formation and the way they get formed in the end makes you in awe of nature and science.

Holograms, interactive touch screens and cool displays will also help you learn more about each mineral and a lot more on chemistry and the elements of nature in action.

I have shared some of the pictures I took inside but they don't do the collection any justice.

Make sure to visit!",MIM Mineral Museum,Beirut,33.8938,35.5018,Beirut,Museums,4.8,524,good museum kind mineral gemstone private collection exact count mineral sure unique size shape colour origin lucky salim story challenge museum entrance fee museum entrance studend kid museum movie certain lighting put value item sure kid student much adult geometrical shape stone year formation way end awe nature science hologram interactive touch screen cool display mineral lot chemistry element nature action picture collection justice sure

16306,Anthony Spencer,2 months ago,1,"The collection is good and definitely worth seeing, but I can't recommend it currently because of their mask rules. This is probably the only place in Lebanon that still forces you to wear a mask (oh, you didn't bring one? Don't worry, you can BUY ONE at the entrance). Even toddlers have to wear a mask. I feel like this is a rule meant to appease leftist western donors of the university.

If you are lucky you ll get a tour with Salim and then you ll be amazed more by the story of each piece. The display is also very well designed to capture you each time from a different point of view either by type or region or rarity. And there is another section about the fossils of Lebanon.

19883,Fadi Sakr,a week ago,5,"The Fortress of Niha is carved into the rocks over a cliff overlooking the Bisti valley. The earliest markings on the rocks date as far back as the Bronze age. Different groups/armies stayed there, including the Crusaders, Mameluks, and Fakhr-el-Dine. The Fortress includes chambers for people and soldiers carved into the rocks, and silos for storing water,  grains and other provisions dug into the rock floor. Water was provided by a system that collected rainwater and also by canalization channeling water from a nearby spring. Succeeding inhabitants built walls leaning against the cliffs to protect the chambers but the walls kept getting destroyed by earthquakes. Many houses in the village of Aray down in the valley are built using the stones that rain down on them every time there is an earthquake.
Overall, the Fortress is an amazing place to visit with excellent views and an amazing walk along the cliffs.",Fortress of Niha,Niha,33.5901,35.6248,Mount Lebanon,Historical Sites,4.6,170,fortress rock early marking rock bronze age different group army crusader fortress chamber people soldier rock silo water grain provision rock floor water system rainwater water nearby spring inhabitant wall cliff chamber wall earthquake many house village valley stone rain earthquake overall amazing excellent view amazing walk cliff

After an easy hike (15-20 min), you access this remote fortress where the Emir Fakhreddine hid from the Ottomans in the 16th c. The fortress is lodged in the cliff and overlooks the wadi connecting the coast to the Bekaa Valley; hence the strategic importance. Soldiers carved an intricate system to channel rain water into carved cisterns. Part of the trail might scare some as there is no handrail overlooking the cliff. The guide from the reserve will provide an explanation of the site. Since it is part of the reserve the site is very quiet. The scenery is stunning.

21080,Marc Boutros,a year ago,5,"In 1958, Bishop Euthym, a man of great devotion to Our Lady, decided to build a shrine in honor of the Virgin Mary on the top of a hill overlooking Zahle and the Bekaa Valley. A ten-meter-high bronze statue of the Virgin Mary, the work of the Italian artist, Pierroti, rests on a 54 meter high tower, crowning a hill known by the name of Tel Chiha. Work on the shrine was delayed for years because of the Lebanese civil war, but an grand inauguration was held in May 2005 after restoration work was completed on the statue. An elevator takes pilgrims and tourists up to a viewing platform overlooking the red-roofed city and offering panoramic views of the valley. The base of the tower houses a small chapel that seats about 100 people.",Lady of Zahle,Zahle,33.8463,35.902,Bekaa,Religious Sites - Church,4.8,722,man great devotion lady meter high bronze statue artist meter high tower hill name chiha work shrine year civil war grand inauguration restoration work statue elevator pilgrim tourist platform red city panoramic base tower small chapel seat people

The water there is sparkling clean and is perfect for swimming. The only way to visit there is by taking a boat from Mina tripoli. There are several tours available, and they charge by person. The return boat is included in this charge. We paid 50,000 LL per person because there is a fuel problem. Usually the price is 30,000 LL. Remember to bring all your stuff with you because there is no shop there. I'd recommend getting
1- water and cups
2- drinks
3- snacks
4- Ice and a coolant to keep your drinks cold
5- umbrella for shade üèñÔ∏è.

The poor complain that this is the last public beach in beirut, they dont deserve any beach if they treat it like theyr own personal dump. They should just privatize the beach it would be better off environmentally.

I had to stop my 1 yr old daughter from playing with cigarette butts and aged plastic almost every 30 seconds.

I really hope the people that come here smarten up,  if they dont i hope they privatize the beach and put a resort on it.

The carelessness is what is wrong with Lebanon.

By the way it probably wouldnt be a bad idea if the government invested in  showers and renovated the changing areas. It looks and smells like hell.

Built around 1336, it was probably situated within a large citrus garden with fountains that enhanced its sacredness. Today, however, it is surrounded by concrete and old buildings, abandoned to their fate.

28479,Ben Rattenbury,2 years ago,5,"A very impressive site, so much to see and explore. The sarcophogi are many and varied. Some are quite ornate, with animal and plant motifs carved into them. Some also have clear inscriptions, presumably describing who was stored within. The triumphal arch is very impressive in its grandiosity and beautiful proportions. But most impressive of all is the hippodrome, appatently the world's most complete remains. You can climb one of the grandstands, from which you get a vivid sense of what it would have been like to see the chariot races back in the day. Overall it was very empty and peaceful, with lots of palm trees and lizards jumping around. Really enjoyed the visit, though we relied on our guide book for information as there is nothing there besides a plaque at the entrance (we could have probably hired a guide if we'd asked around but no-one offered their services to us).

My wife and I walked there from the old harbour through what google maps called a refugee camp but it felt more like a residential neighbourhood. Took half an hour. Entrance cost 6000 each.
